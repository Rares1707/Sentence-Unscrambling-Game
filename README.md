# Sentence-Unscrambling-Game

## Overview
This project represents my solution to the final exam for the Fundamentals of Programming module at my university. It is a console-based game with the following structure:
- the user receives a scrambled sentence where the whitespaces, the first letter of each word, and the last letter of each word retain their initial positions
- the user swaps pairs of letters until he arrives at the intial sentence
- if the user remains without moves, then they lose
- the fewer swaps the user makes, the higher their score will be

## Features
- built using layered architecture
- the initial sentence (unscrambled) is chosen randomly from a text file
- the sentence is scrambled randomly, but without breaking the rules stated above
- the commands inputed by the user are interpreted by the program
- if a command is invalid, then the program raises an exception and the user is notified
- the user is able to undo the last operation
